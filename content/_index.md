# Christy's Log

Hi, my name is Christy. I'm currently an ML engineer at Boston Dynamics, and before that, I was studying CS at Harvard ('24). I'm hoping to use this site to share some project updates as well as ideas I have. Any idea I share is totally fair game for other people to work on, and often I'll be doing it because I don't have the resources, time, or know-how to implement it myself â€” or I just think it'd be great if more people were working on it.
